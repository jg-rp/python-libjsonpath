# libjsonpath

This was an early attempt at Python bindings for [libjsonpath](https://github.com/jg-rp/libjsonpath) using [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). No releases were ever published and this repo is now archived.

See https://github.com/jg-rp/jsonpath24 for a fast, actively maintained JSONPath Python package built on libjsonpath.
